# Tape Tree
### What is this?

The original idea was to play with creative coding. The main goal was to create a tree based on Tape Tree rules, available at [Conditional Design](https://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/tape-is-made-from-trees/).

Each execution is unique. The trees got generated in a different way, with different colors and formats.

### Teaser

The project got expanded and I wanted to add something related to the Butterfly Effect. That is, every action done now can have its consequences in the future. Even the simple flapping of the wings of a butterfly can make changes in the world. That is Caos theory.

A teaser was created to make people feel that idea.

### Development

Made in Xcode Playgrounds for macOS, easily portable to iOS and tvOS.

### Reference
Rules for drawing the tree were based on:
[Conditional Design - Tape is made from trees](https://conditionaldesign.org/workshops/tape-is-made-from-trees/)

### Results
Some results generated by running this Playground.
